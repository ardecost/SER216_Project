Exception upon startup:  
java.io.FileNotFoundException: mathgraphics.properties (The system cannot find the file specified)

"Displayed" is mis-spelled on GUI

"Theta" is mis-spelled on GUI

Arrow L,R not working as well as up/down. When you press L or R, it doesn't move very far at all, it seems too sensitive; U or D moves further.  I wonder if this is just the window sizing.  (may not cause any problems)
  
Mouse wheel up/down is reversed (this may not be a problem, perhaps preference).  

Coordinates missing from 3D view, they show for both 2D graphs.  

Visualizer.java mis-spelled variable (Cosmetic) :   
public static int BUTTOMBORDER=100;
